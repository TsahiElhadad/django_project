# django_project
My first website using django web platforme.
I choose to build my site using Django platform, which is very popular among Python programmers.  <br/> 
In addition, I used bootstrap, html, css to design the site and build the pages. <br/>
 <br/>
The site is a blog that simulates an app such as Twitter, having a registration system and user login.  <br/>
Users share their stories with each other and there is an ability to be interested in the stories of  <br/>
a unique user using a filter I been created. <br/>

I enjoyed building the site with the help of Django platform and it was very effective for my purpose.
